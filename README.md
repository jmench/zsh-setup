# zsh-setup
Just keeping track of my zsh setup for future reference. Here's how it looks on load:

If using iTerm, you can also edit the status bar by going to iTerm2 > Preferences > Profile > Session and toggle the option at the bottom for "Status bar enabled". You can add all kinds of information to it by going into "Configure Status bar" in the same section.

You can edit where the status bar is placed by navigating to the "Appearance" tab in Prefeneces and selecting Top or Bottom for "Status bar location". I prefer it at the bottom :)
